# Work Items — 1.4.1

Theme: **UI quality + HA native integration.** Harden the frontend (split the DevicesTab god component, close accessibility gaps, clean up the API layer, backfill e2e coverage), and make Distributed ESPHome a first-class HA citizen with native services, update entities, and mDNS discovery.

## UI Cleanup

- [x] ~~**QS.1**~~ WONTFIX *(1.4.1-dev.5 audit)* — `src/lib/utils.ts` exports `cn()` (tailwind-merge + clsx), which is imported by 7 shadcn components (`ui/dialog.tsx`, `ui/badge.tsx`, `ui/button.tsx`, `ui/checkbox.tsx`, `ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`, `ui/select.tsx`, `ui/input.tsx`). The original grep in this item missed the `@/lib/utils` alias path. Keeping the file.
- [x] **QS.2** *(1.4.1-dev.5)* — `aria-label` (+ `aria-pressed` on the toggles) added to the 5 icon-only buttons:
  - App.tsx theme toggle (☀/☾) — `aria-label` + `aria-pressed={theme==='light'}`
  - App.tsx streamer mode (👁/🔒) — `aria-label` + `aria-pressed={streamerMode}`
  - DevicesTab row hamburger (⋮) — already added in QS.16 (`aria-label="More actions"`)
  - DevicesTab column picker (⚙) — `aria-label="Toggle columns"`
  - EsphomeVersionDropdown refresh (↻) — already added during PR #54 review
- [x] **QS.3** *(1.4.1-dev.5)* — Converted `<span onClick>` to `<button type="button">` for Secrets, theme toggle, streamer toggle in App.tsx. SortHeader already landed in QS.21.
- [x] **QS.4** *(1.4.1-dev.5)* — Replaced `data.key!` non-null assertion in `getApiKey()` with an explicit null-check that throws `Error('Server did not return an API key')`. Callers (DeviceContextMenu) now get a meaningful message instead of crashing downstream on `clipboard.writeText(undefined)`.
- [x] **QS.5** *(1.4.1-dev.5)* — Device interface already had `compile_target?: string | null` (the referenced line had moved); added the JSDoc block clarifying the Device-vs-Target distinction and what `compile_target: null` means (unmanaged device, no matching YAML).
- [x] **QS.6** *(1.4.1-dev.5)* — Dropped the custom `JSON.stringify`-based `deepCompare`. SWR's default stable-hash compare already prevents re-renders when polled data is structurally unchanged, and the custom version was O(n) per tick + broke on undefined/circular + hid legitimate key-order differences.
- [x] **QS.7** *(1.4.1-dev.5)* — Replaced the five `onError: () => {}` silent swallows with a `logSwrError(key)` helper that does `console.error('SWR', key, err)`. Each SWR key (`serverInfo`, `versions`, `workers`, `devices`, `queue`) now bubbles errors to the console with its identity attached. Stretch (top-of-page banner when `serverInfo` SWR has an error) not implemented — deferred to WORKITEMS tbd if we actually see errors in the logs.

## API Layer Cleanup

- [ ] **QS.8 Extract `parseResponse<T>` helper** — every POST endpoint in `api/client.ts` repeats the same ~3-line error-handling pattern. Extract into a shared helper. Reduces ~150 lines of boilerplate.
- [ ] **QS.9 Define response types at module top** — replace inline `as { enqueued: number }` casts with named interfaces (`CompileResponse`, `CancelResponse`, etc.). Self-documents the wire contract.
- [ ] **QS.10 Propagate server error details in getX() functions** — `getTargets`, `getDevices`, `getWorkers`, `getQueue` currently throw generic `"Failed to fetch X"`, losing server-provided error text.

## Component Hygiene

- [ ] **QS.11 Extract `<Label>` component** — `components/ui/label.tsx`. The same label className pattern appears 10+ times across modals. Extract as a shadcn-style Label with proper `htmlFor`/`id` association.
- [ ] **QS.12 Replace raw `<input>` in RenameModal** — `DevicesTab.tsx:198-204` uses raw `<input>` with inline style object. Swap for `<Input>` wrapper.
- [ ] **QS.13 Add `<ButtonGroup>` component (or `variant="group"`)** — shell toggle in `ConnectWorkerModal` and mode toggle in `ScheduleModal` both use inline style overrides. Extract proper component.
- [ ] **QS.14 Audit and convert inline `style={{ ... }}` to Tailwind** — 25+ instances across `ConnectWorkerModal`, `DeviceLogModal`, `WorkersTab`, `QueueTab`, `EsphomeVersionDropdown`, `StatusDot`.
- [ ] **QS.15 Icon strategy decision + rollout** — currently mixes Lucide, emoji, and HTML entities. Decide and document in CLAUDE.md Design Judgment.

## DevicesTab Split

The current `DevicesTab.tsx` is **1,173 lines with 24 hooks** and an ESLint disable for missing deps. Splitting it unblocks the 1.5 tag/group-by work that touches the same file.

- [x] **QS.16** *(1.4.1-dev.2)* — Replaced hand-rolled `DeviceMenu` with shadcn `DropdownMenu`. Dropped the manual positioning logic (`translateX(-100%)`, viewport-flip math, click-catching backdrop). New `components/devices/DeviceContextMenu.tsx`; placement, focus trap, click-outside, Escape, and keyboard nav now come from Radix.
- [x] **QS.17** *(1.4.1-dev.2)* — Extracted the 369-line columns `useMemo` into `components/devices/useDeviceColumns.tsx`. Removed the `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. DevicesTab.tsx 1,001 → 631 lines.
- [x] **QS.18** *(1.4.1-dev.2)* — Extracted bulk Actions dropdown + bulk schedule modal into `components/devices/DeviceTableActions.tsx`. Owns its own `bulkScheduleOpen` state.
- [x] **QS.19** *(1.4.1-dev.2)* — Moved `RenameModal` + `DeleteModal` to `components/devices/DeviceTableModals.tsx`. RenameModal re-exported so existing App.tsx imports keep working.
- [x] **QS.20** *(1.4.1-dev.2)* — Memoized `handlePin`/`handleUnpin` in DevicesTab and `handleCompile`/`handleOpenUpgradeModal`/`handleDeleteDevice`/`handleRenameDevice`/`switchTab` in App.tsx so `useDeviceColumns`' dep array actually caches across SWR polls.
- [x] **QS.21** *(1.4.1-dev.2)* — Extracted shared `SortHeader` to `components/ui/sort-header.tsx`. Click target is a real `<button>` (semantic HTML); the `<th>` gets `aria-sort` via a `getAriaSort()` helper. Cascaded to all 11 sortable columns across Devices, Queue, Schedules.

## EditorModal + Utils Split

- [ ] **QS.22 Split `EditorModal.tsx` Monaco setup into `editor/` submodule** — extract `monacoSetup.ts`, `completionProvider.ts`, `useYamlValidation.ts`. EditorModal stays as dialog wrapper.
- [ ] **QS.23 Split `src/utils.ts` grab-bag** — into `utils/format.ts`, `utils/jobState.ts`, `utils/cron.ts`.
- [ ] **QS.24 Remove dead `_onRename` parameter in `EditorModal.tsx:232`**.

## Tests and Safety Net

- [ ] **QS.25 Add missing e2e coverage** — mocked Playwright tests for: rename, delete, pin/unpin, upgrade modal, schedule modal, bulk schedule/remove, worker cache clean, column visibility persistence, theme persistence.
- [ ] **QS.26 Add React Error Boundary around `<App />`** — minimal boundary rendering a "Something went wrong — reload" card.
- [ ] **QS.27 Optional polish** — lower-priority items: `ConnectWorkerModal` 8× useState → useReducer, `address_source` union type, `LogModal` setInterval comment, persist sort order, URL query params for deep-linking.

## Playwright Coverage Backfill

### Mocked tests (`ha-addon/ui/e2e/`)

- [ ] **PT.1 `pin-unpin.spec.ts`** — Pin via hamburger → 📌 appears; unpin → 📌 disappears; upgrade modal warning on pinned device; bulk compile request intercepted.
- [ ] **PT.2 `schedule-modal.spec.ts`** — Modal opens in correct mode (Now vs Scheduled); mode switch; create recurring/one-time schedule; pause schedule; edit from Schedules tab.
- [ ] **PT.3 `schedules-tab.spec.ts`** — Table columns/search/filter; checkbox select-all + "Remove Selected"; bulk remove; empty state.
- [ ] **PT.4 `bulk-schedule.spec.ts`** — "Schedule Selected..." and "Remove Schedule from Selected" via Actions dropdown.
- [ ] **PT.5 `queue-extras.spec.ts`** — Triggered column icons; Rerun vs Retry labels; Cancelled badge; Clear doesn't touch cancelled.
- [ ] **PT.6 `modal-sizing.spec.ts`** — Editor/log modal bounding box vs viewport at 1024×768 and 1920×1080.
- [ ] **PT.7 `button-consistency.spec.ts`** — Toolbar button heights equal across all tabs.
- [ ] **PT.8 `cancel-new-device.spec.ts`** — Cancel without saving triggers delete API.

### Prod tests (`ha-addon/ui/e2e-hass-4/`)

- [ ] **PT.9 `schedule-fires.spec.ts`** — One-time schedule fires on real server, auto-clears.
- [ ] **PT.10 `incremental-build.spec.ts`** — Second compile ≥50% faster than first.
- [ ] **PT.11 `pinned-bulk-compile.spec.ts`** — Pinned version honored in bulk compile.

### Fixture updates

- [ ] **PT.12 Update `e2e/fixtures.ts`** — add pinned device, scheduled device, one-time schedule, scheduled queue job, cancelled queue job.

## HA Native Integration

Custom integration that makes Distributed ESPHome a first-class HA citizen: native services callable from automations, `update` entities on the HA dashboard, and zero-config discovery via mDNS. Auto-installed by the add-on on startup (files copied to `/config/custom_components/`, user confirms via the Integrations UI).

**Auto-install mechanism:** The add-on already maps `homeassistant_config` (for reading ESPHome YAMLs). Change to `read_only: false` so we can write to `/config/custom_components/`. On startup, an s6 script compares the bundled integration version against what's installed and copies if newer. Then calls the Supervisor API to reload custom components. This is the same pattern used by other community add-ons — not an official API, but widely used and stable.

**Discovery:** The server advertises `_distributed-esphome._tcp` via mDNS. The integration's `manifest.json` declares a `zeroconf` matcher. HA shows "Distributed ESPHome discovered" → user clicks Configure → one confirmation screen → done. Falls back to manual URL entry if mDNS isn't working.

- [ ] **HI.1 Integration scaffold** — `custom_integration/distributed_esphome/` directory with: `__init__.py`, `manifest.json` (domain, zeroconf discovery, version), `config_flow.py` (mDNS auto-discovery + manual URL fallback), `const.py`, `strings.json`, `translations/en.json`. Integration type: `hub`.
- [ ] **HI.2 Services** — register three HA services:
  - `distributed_esphome.compile` — target (entity/device selector or `"all"`/`"outdated"`), optional `esphome_version`, optional `worker`. Calls `POST /ui/api/compile`.
  - `distributed_esphome.cancel` — job_id or target. Calls `POST /ui/api/queue/cancel`.
  - `distributed_esphome.validate` — target. Calls `POST /ui/api/validate`.
  - Each defined in `services.yaml` with selectors so the HA automation editor gives full autocomplete.
- [ ] **HI.3 Update entities** — one `UpdateEntity` per managed device. `installed_version` from device poller. `latest_version` from global ESPHome version (or pinned version). `async_install()` calls compile API. HA's update card shows "Update available" + "Install" button for free.
- [ ] **HI.4 Sensor entities** — `sensor.distributed_esphome_queue_depth`, per-device firmware version, per-worker active job count.
- [ ] **HI.5 Binary sensor entities** — `binary_sensor.distributed_esphome_<worker>_online` with `device_class: connectivity`.
- [ ] **HI.6 Event firing** — fire `distributed_esphome_compile_complete` event on job terminal state. Data: target, state, duration, version, worker. Automation trigger for "notify me when any compile fails."
- [ ] **HI.7 mDNS advertisement** — server advertises `_distributed-esphome._tcp.local.` with `version` and `base_url` properties.
- [ ] **HI.8 Auto-install on add-on startup** — s6-overlay service script. Compare versions, copy if newer, reload via Supervisor API (`$SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`). Log outcome at INFO.
- [ ] **HI.9 config.yaml change** — `homeassistant_config` mapping to `read_only: false`. Document in `DOCS.md`. PY-4 trigger — bump `IMAGE_VERSION`.
- [ ] **HI.10 Coordinator + polling** — `DataUpdateCoordinator` polls targets/devices/workers/queue every 30s. All entities read from coordinator cache.
- [ ] **HI.11 Device registry** — each managed device registered as an HA device with name, model (board/platform), sw_version, via_device (last worker).
- [ ] **HI.12 Tests** — service call verification, update entity state, config flow mDNS + manual URL, auto-install script.

## Server Performance

- [x] **SP.1** *(1.4.1-dev.7)* — Added `compression_middleware` to the aiohttp app that calls `response.enable_compression()` on any `StreamResponse` that's not a WebSocket and doesn't already have `Content-Encoding`. aiohttp honors the client's `Accept-Encoding` so it's a no-op on clients that don't send gzip, and skips already-compressed responses. Works for every `/ui/api/*` JSON response, static JS/CSS assets, and the INDEX_HTML template — all uncompressed before. On a 50-device `/ui/api/targets` response (~40-50 KB) this is a ~5× shrink, and on the 1 Hz polls for workers/devices/queue it adds up fast over mobile/VPN links.
- [x] **SP.2** *(1.4.1-dev.7)* — `/ui/api/queue` now strips `log` from **every** job in the list response, not just pending/working. Previously terminal jobs carried up to 512 KB of log each in the 1 Hz poll; 10 finished jobs = ~5 MB/s of redundant payload on steady-state (the log modal already fetches individually). Frontend: QueueTab's `hasLog` changed from `job.log || inProgress` to `job.state !== 'pending'` (terminal jobs still show the Log button because the modal lazy-loads via `/ui/api/jobs/{id}/log`). LogModal's terminal-job path now also calls `startPolling(jobId)` instead of writing `currentJob.log` directly — does one full HTTP fetch and stops as soon as `finished: true`.
- [x] **SP.3** *(1.4.1-dev.7, already fixed + small cleanup)* — The referenced `app.get` vs `app["_rt"]` key mismatch was already fixed in 1.4.0 (commit `3ac6ded`). Live `ha addons logs` verification: the repeated INFO messages I saw were all during the push-to-hass-4 restart window (add-on restarts ~10 s apart during deploy); in steady state the logs fire exactly once per startup and then stay silent until the actual HA ESPHome add-on version changes. Small cleanup nonetheless: demoted `scanner.set_esphome_version`'s own INFO log to DEBUG since the three callers (on_startup, pypi_version_refresher, `/ui/api/esphome-version` POST handler) already log their own INFO with better context ("Active ESPHome version: X", "…detected: X", "…changed to X via UI"), and the generic helper was just duplicating the message at startup.

## Dependency Updates

Triage and merge the 8 open Dependabot PRs. Group into low-risk auto-merge, medium-risk CI-verify, and high-risk human review per the v1.3.1 release-checklist pattern.

### Low-risk — merge on green CI

- [ ] **DU.1** [PR #53](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/53) — `globals` 17.4.0 → 17.5.0 (ui devDep, patch bump, ESLint globals list)
- [ ] **DU.2** [PR #51](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/51) — `typescript-eslint` 8.58.0 → 8.58.2 (ui devDep, patch bump)
- [ ] **DU.3** [PR #52](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/52) — `lucide-react` 1.7.0 → 1.8.0 (ui dep, minor; icon library, only affects rendered icons; if QS.15 adopts Lucide universally, bump here first)

### Medium-risk — merge after full Playwright + smoke test

- [ ] **DU.4** [PR #49](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/49) — `@base-ui/react` 1.3.0 → 1.4.0 (ui dep, minor). Powers every shadcn wrapper (Button, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Select, Checkbox). Run the full 43-test mocked suite + hass-4 prod suite before merging. Watch for changes in focus management, portal positioning, or event bubbling on dialogs/dropdowns.
- [ ] **DU.5** [PR #50](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/50) — `@types/node` 24.12.0 → 25.6.0 (ui devDep, major). Pure type change, but Node 25 typings may tighten or add new required fields and surface new type errors in `vite.config.ts` or any Node-API usage. Verify `tsc -b` is clean after bump.

### High-risk — human review required

- [ ] **DU.6** [PR #48](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/48) — `docker/build-push-action` v6 → v7 (actions, major). Read v7 release notes — action inputs or default behaviours may have changed. Affects both `publish-client.yml` and `publish-server.yml`. Test on a dry-run workflow dispatch before merging to main.
- [ ] **DU.7** [PR #47](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/47) — `docker/login-action` v3 → v4 (actions, major). Usually a stable bump (same `registry`/`username`/`password` inputs), but confirm against v4 release notes. Affects both publish workflows.
- [ ] **DU.8** [PR #46](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/pull/46) — `actions/checkout` v4 → v6 (actions, major, two versions jumped). v5 and v6 both required Node 24 on the runner; verify our runners have it (ubuntu-latest is fine). Affects `ci.yml`, `compile-test.yml`, and both publish workflows. Read v5 + v6 release notes for any flag renames.

### Process

- [ ] **DU.9** After all 8 merge, rerun `bash scripts/refresh-deps.sh` if any Python `requirements.txt` direct deps end up bumped by transitive resolution. Not expected since all 8 PRs are npm or GitHub Actions, but confirm.
- [ ] **DU.10** If any PR is rebased by Dependabot after merging an earlier one (conflicts in `package-lock.json`), let Dependabot handle the rebase automatically (`@dependabot rebase` comment) rather than merging manually.

## Open Bugs & Tweaks

- [ ] **#1** ([GitHub](https://github.com/weirded/distributed-esphome/issues/56)) — Top bar doesn't scroll on mobile (iOS). The header/nav row is sticky/fixed on narrow viewports, so the ESPHome logo, version dropdown, Secrets/theme toggles, and worker/version chips can't be reached when the viewport is narrower than their combined width. Fix candidates: allow horizontal scroll on the header's flex container at narrow widths, or collapse secondary controls (secrets, theme, streamer) into a kebab menu below a mobile breakpoint. Verify on iOS Safari — the existing `theme-responsive.spec.ts` has narrow-viewport tests but doesn't exercise header scrolling.
- [x] **#2** *(1.4.1-dev.3)* — Hamburger menu closed on every 1Hz SWR poll. Regression from QS.16: the new shadcn `DropdownMenu` lived inside the row's actions cell, where re-mounts (triggered by columns memo invalidation on `activeJobsByTarget` and inline-arrow refs) tore down its internal open state. Fix: lifted open state to DevicesTab as `menuOpenTarget: string | null`, threaded through `useDeviceColumns` to `DeviceContextMenu` as controlled `open` + `onOpenChange` props. The state now survives any number of row remounts because it lives outside the row tree. Also updated two e2e tests to use `getByRole('menuitem')` since Radix's items are correctly typed as menuitems (was `getByRole('button')` matching the old hand-rolled `<button>` elements). 
- [x] **#3** *(1.4.1-dev.4)* — After the #2 fix the menu stayed open but the content visibly flashed on every 1Hz SWR poll. Cause: SWR hands us a fresh `target` object reference each poll (same values, new object), so `DeviceContextMenu` re-rendered unconditionally — Radix's overlay briefly re-mounted/animated each time. Fix: wrapped `DeviceContextMenu` in `React.memo` with a custom `propsEqual` that compares only the `Target` fields actually read in render (`target`, `has_restart_button`, `has_api_key`, `pinned_version`) plus `open`, and treats function props as always-equal (identity changes don't affect behavior because they close over the same underlying handlers). The menu now renders once and stays rendered across polls. Also fixed the `e2e-hass-4/cyd-office-info.spec.ts` live-logs smoke test to use `getByRole('menuitem')` instead of `getByRole('button')` (same Radix-menuitem fix as the two mocked tests in #2). 
- [x] **#4** *(1.4.1-dev.6)* — Even after #3's `React.memo` on `DeviceContextMenu`, the overlay visibly twitched while the menu was open. Likely root cause: the actions-cell body was still an inline arrow inside `useDeviceColumns` that React reconciled on every poll. Even though the memo'd menu itself was skip-rendered, the surrounding `<Button>Upgrade</Button><Button>Edit</Button>` siblings re-evaluated every tick with fresh inline `onClick` closures and a fresh `style={{...}}` object literal, which nudged the trigger's bounding box enough for Base UI's Positioner to re-fire. Fix: extracted the cell body into a dedicated `React.memo`'d `ActionsCell` component (`components/devices/ActionsCell.tsx`) with a tight prop compare (target fields actually read, `inFlight`, `menuOpen`); moved the inline `style` to a module-level const so the `<div>` style prop is referentially stable; added `data-[state=closed]:!animate-none` to the DropdownMenu popup so any residual state cycle is invisible instead of animating. Also updated the four `header span[title*="..."]` selectors in mocked e2e tests (theme + streamer toggles) to `header button[...]` to match the `<span>`→`<button>` conversion landed in QS.3.
- [ ] 5 Let's actually fix the assertion error that's happening at a rapid pace in the add-on logs.
