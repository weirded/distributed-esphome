# Wipe the standalone compose stack on $STANDALONE_HOST back to a
# clean slate. Safe to run before a deploy to guarantee no state
# leaks between HT.14 regression runs, and safe to run repeatedly.
#
# What it removes:
#   - Both containers (server + worker)
#   - Named volumes (esphome-dist-data, esphome-versions) — this wipes
#     the git-versioning history, firmware archive, settings.json
#   - The config-esphome bind-mount directory
#   - The compose-dir .env file
#
# What it intentionally keeps:
#   - The compose dir itself (cheap to recreate; saves one rsync)
#   - The local $STANDALONE_TOKEN_FILE (next deploy reuses the token
#     by design — matches scripts/haos/ onboarding conventions)
#
# Env overrides:
#   STANDALONE_HOST         (default docker-pve)
#   STANDALONE_COMPOSE_DIR  (default /opt/esphome-fleet)
